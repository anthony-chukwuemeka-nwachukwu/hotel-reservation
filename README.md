# hotel-reservation
An application that allows users to make room reservation in a hotel.

This application design and implementation is intended to show my newly learned skill on object oriented programming with Java.

The architecture of the APP is shown below

The User interface which is a command line based has the following feature:

### Main Menu
The application provides four user scenarios:
1. Creating a customer account.
2. Searching and Booking for rooms using checkin and checkout dates.
3. Viewing reservations.
4. Open Admin Menu
5. Exit the App

### Admin Menu
The application provides four administrative scenarios:
1. Displaying all customers accounts.
2. Viewing all of the rooms in the hotel.
3. Viewing all of the hotel reservations.
4. Adding a room to the hotel application.
5. Back to the User Menu

To use the App, run the `UIComponentsTester.java` file
