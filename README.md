# hotel-reservation
An application that allows users to make room reservation in a hotel.

This application design and implementation is intended to show my newly learned skill on object oriented programming with Java. It may lack some other important skill sets required by a JAVA developer like good design patterns but my subsequent designs will cover that.

The architecture of the APP is shown below

The User interface which is a command line based has the following feature:

### User Menu
The application provides four user scenarios:
1. Creating a customer account.
2. Searching and Booking for rooms using checkin and checkout dates.
3. Viewing reservations.
4. Open Admin Menu
5. Exit the App

### Admin Menu
The application provides four administrative scenarios:
1. Displaying all customers accounts.
2. Viewing all of the rooms in the hotel.
3. Viewing all of the hotel reservations.
4. Adding a room to the hotel application.
5. Back to the User Menu

To use the App, run the `UIComponentsTester.java` file
